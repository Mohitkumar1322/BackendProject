-`routes` -> in the routes folder we are registering the route and with that route which controller or middleware sshould trigger.
-`middleware`-> they are just going to intercept the incoming req where we can wwrite our validator,auth,etc,
-`constrollers`-> they are kind of the last middleware as post them you call you business layer to execute the business logic .
-`repositories`-> this folder contains all the logic using which we interact the  DB by writing queries
-`services`-> contains the business logcs and interact with repo for data from the db
